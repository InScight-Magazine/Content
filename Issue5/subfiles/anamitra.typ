[We are deeply saddened by the untimely passing of *ANAMITRA ROY*, a PhD student and BS-MS alumnus of IISER Kolkata. A passionate scientist, he understood the importance of science communication and always found time alongside his research to engage in outreach.

#parbreak()
Through his popular science writings in various publications and his volunteering for outreach activities at IISER Kolkata, we are confident that he inspired many with his infectious passion for science. We at InScight shall fondly remember his quiet encouragement and appreciation of our work as IISER Kolkataâ€™s science magazine, and we will continue to draw inspiration from him.

*May his soul rest in peace.*

[_We share here a photograph he took of IISER Kolkata's victory in IICM, which captures the spirit and enthusiasm he brought to every walk of life. May it stand as a reminder of the passion he inspired in those around him._]
