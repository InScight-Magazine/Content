It is with immense pride and joy that I introduce the inaugural issue of InScight, IISER Kolkata's Science Communication Magazine. This initiative embodies our collective aspiration to make scientific knowledge accessible and engaging for a broader audience. As an institution committed to research and education, we are always searching for ways to bridge the gap between cutting-edge science and society, and InScight is a testament to this mission.
In an era where information is at our fingertips, the ability to communicate science effectively is more crucial than ever. Our endeavour to convey scientific concepts in a way that resonates with individuals beyond specialized fields reflects the core philosophy of IISER Kolkata: to inspire curiosity, foster inquiry, and build a community that appreciates the value of science. The magazine’s foundation on a Class 11 and 12 level of understanding ensures that students, educators, and the public alike can find inspiration in these pages.
The team behind InScight has set an ambitious vision not just to present scientific achievements but to tell stories that connect the intricacies of scientific discoveries with their broader implications. It is indeed encouraging to see this inaugural issue feature interviews with luminaries like Dr. Shyama Narendranath from ISRO, alongside contributions from our talented students across various programs. Such an inclusive effort strengthens our belief that science communication can transcend conventional boundaries and foster a culture of open dialogue.
I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the faculty mentors—Prof. Somnath Basu, Prof. Subhajit Bandopadhyay, and Prof. Anindita Bhadra—for their guidance in nurturing this endeavor. InScight not only highlights the research at IISER Kolkata but also shines a spotlight on the perspectives, ideas, and stories that can inspire the next generation of scientists.
As we publish this first issue, I extend my best wishes to the entire editorial team and contributors. May this magazine grow as a beacon of scientific literacy, and evolve into a multilingual platform that transcends barriers, expanding its reach to audiences far and wide.
With my warmest regards,
