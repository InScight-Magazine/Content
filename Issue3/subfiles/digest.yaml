  "Title": "New Functions for an Old Protein: How Does RAS Drive Migration in Human Cells?"
  "Summary": "In mammalian cells, directed migration is crucial for a multitude of physiological processes ranging from embryogenesis, cancer metastasis, to immune response. Although Ras and its downstream pathways are typically associated with longer-term growth control, our studies showed how the Ras-mTORC2-Akt growth-control axis steers leukocyte migration on a rapid timescale, independently of new gene or protein expression. To this end, we designed blue-light controlled, cryptochrome-based dimerizers to abruptly and locally perturb Ras or Akt activity in human neutrophils and macrophages, bypassing the chemoattractant-sensing receptor/G-protein network. Within seconds of global recruitment of CAAX-deleted version of constitutively active Ras isoforms or a RasGEF, RasGRP4, initially quiescent cells spread and migrated rapidly. Thus, Ras proteins directly promote random motility. Furthermore, by activating Ras at the cell rear, new F-actin rich protrusions emerged locally, thereby reversing pre-existing polarity and steering sustained migration towards the light source. Interestingly, locally recruiting the crucial Ras-mTORC2 effector, Akt1 or Akt2, had similar effects. Next, employing a RasGAP, RASAL3, we were interested to test the effects of reducing Ras in migrating cells. Globally or locally dampening Ras activity at cell fronts could extinguish protrusions and abolish polarity or migration, as expected. However, surprisingly, an acute reduction in Ras activity specifically at the cell back increased both polarity and random motility. Further experimentation showed that cell polarity can be achieved by suppressing Ras activity at the cell rear resulting in locally increased actomyosin contractility. These unexpected outcomes of attenuating Ras activity naturally had strong, context-dependent consequences for chemotaxis. Our experimental results upended existing models of cell polarity, and a new computational model in which Ras levels control separate front and back feedback loops was proposed. Taken together, our unanticipated findings on cell polarity and migration have crucial implications for cancer treatment. While a target of intense interest for cancer therapy, Ras inhibition may not always be beneficial i.e., attempts to abrogate cell proliferation could force cells into a more polarized migratory state, thereby promoting metastasis. Minimally, our study suggests that a deeper understanding of the different roles of Ras activity is needed for developing therapeutic strategies."

  "Title": "Recyclable Bio-based Polyethylene-like Materials: Synthesized via Acceptor-less Dehydrogenative Polymerization of Bio-derived Diols and Catalyst-enabled Closed-loop Recycling"
  "Summary": "The widespread applications of petroleum-derived polyolefins can be attributed to their favorable physicochemical properties and economic viability. However, the environmental footprint of polyolefins is increasingly concerning, as their mass-production, single-use-nature, and slow decomposition contribute to long-term ecological pollution. Chemical recycling of polyolefins, conventionally involves processes-pyrolysis or steam cracking resulting in significantly lower yields of constituting monomers even under high temperatures(~800 °C) or harsh conditions.
Effective resolution of this issue is contingent upon the development of polyethylene-like polymers that are both chemically recyclable and capable of replicating the key attributes of traditional polyolefins. Inclusion of ester or amide functionalities can operate as predetermined breaking sites within the polymer chain, enabling depolymerization at milder condition and yielding monomers suitable for re-polymerization.
In the aforementioned paper, Miyake and co-workers had reported the synthesis of bio-based polyethylene-like polymer-materials from linear and branched diols via Acceptor-less Dehydrogenative Polymerization(ADP), which display efficient depolymerization too, catalyzed with earth-abundant Manganese complex and exhibit highly tunable material properties. The crystallizable saturated linear monomer and unsaturated monomer were derived from fatty acids (plant-based oils), contributing high melting temperature(Tm) and modulus with its long linear methylene chains. The thiol-ene reactions with thiols, yielding high efficiency, enables the synthesis of branched monomers influencing polymer morphologies and thermomechanical properties. The authors had highlighted the manganese-based complex [Mn] as the most efficient catalyst for this Acceptor-less Dehydrogenative Polymerization and also depolymerization too, attaining high conversion and turnover number with the low catalyst loading and addition of suitable base.
The synthesized thermoplastic polymers demonstrated thermal properties comparable to commercial polyethylenes, with decomposition temperature of 395 °C and melting point(Tm). Increasing the content of branched co-monomers reduced crystallinity and modulus, ultimately leading to elastomeric behavior, while all compositions maintained high tensile strength(σUTS=16–27 MPa) and toughness(UT=100-180 MJ m−3), outstripping that of commercial plastics. Additionally, these PE-like materials showed excellent environmental stability and incorporating thioether or sulfone groups in the copolymers exhibited excellent adhesion to various surfaces-including stainless steel, aluminum and so on.
To overcome the traditional plastic recycling challenges, the authors introduced efficient chemical depolymerization of synthesized bio-based-PE-like polymers driven by hydrogen gas in the presence of mixed commercial plastics using the Mn-based catalyst[Mn], achieving high monomer recovery(91-99%), leaving other plastics impurities unaltered. The recovered monomers were successfully repolymerized through multiple cycles without loss of efficiency and stability, confirming the robustness of the closed-loop process. Furthermore, high-yield monomer recovery was achieved even in the presence of post-consumer plastics and at larger scales, highlighting the system’s practical and scalable recycling potential and route to sustainability."

  "Title": "GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo during the Second Part of the Third Observing Run"
  "Summary": "This paper, “GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo during the Second Part of the Third Observing Run”, is an excerpt from the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog. The report was published in December 2023 in the journal Physical Review X that reports on observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA for the second half of the period of the third observing run. The interval covered is from November 1, 2019, through March 27, 2020. Our very own Professor Rajesh Kumble Nayak has been a part of this team from IISER Kolkata.

  The paper also lists 35 new gravitational-wave events detected during that period, all the result of a \"compact binary coalescence\" in which pairs of black holes or neutron stars orbit ever tighter until they eventually merge. This brings the number of gravitational-wave detections across three observation runs to 90. Most of the events in the catalog arise from the merger of black holes, which can be  pretty large, but this observing run also marks the first definite identification of neutron star–black hole (NSBH) mergers. Curiously, however, no BNS mergers were confirmed during this period.

  The researchers selected these signals with advanced algorithms and data calibration, estimating probabilities for each event to be of astrophysical rather than noise artifacts. As there is always some inevitable noise, the  probability for these signals to be due to a non- astrophysical origin is estimated to be around 10-15%. All  the data are made available in the public domain for use by the community through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center. The expanding dataset from GWTC-3 gives unparalleled insight into the properties and behaviors of black holes and neutron stars, offering unique insights into the population in the universe and providing informative input into the theory governing their formation, structure, and evolution."

  "Title": "Strange Metal and Quantum Spin Liquid in Heavy-Fermion Material: An Array of Exotic Phases"
  "Summary": "Strange metals and spin liquids constitute deviations from the \"standard model\" of condensed matter physics. For most of the twentieth century, metals were believed to be  smoothly connected to non-interacting electrons at low- energies (the so-called Landau's Fermi liquid theory), and  insulators and superconductors were believed to arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking (the ground state does not have all symmetries of the Hamiltonian). Violations of these ideas were observed in the 1980s, a notable example being the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxide materials. The strange metal phase of the  copper oxides, while being a metal, displayed a linear-in- temperature resistivity, in contrast to the quadratic-in- temperature resistivty of Landau Fermi liquids. Due to the  large transition temperature of the material and the proximity to an electronic-correlation driven Mott insulator, Phillip Anderson hyppthesised that the ground state of the Mott insulator was close to a \"spin liquid\", where the system does not settle into any particular configuration (in contrast to the symmetry-broken insulators) but keeps shifting (in the sense of a quantum superposition) between various configurations.

  While these exotic phases typically emerge in different materials, the authors of the present work have experimentally realised these exotic phases in crystals of  the material Ba4 Nb1-xRu3+xO12, where x is the hole- doping concentration. By tuning the doping concentration,  the material undergoes transition from a heavy strange metal phase to a heavy Fermi liquid phase to finally a spin liquid phase. The \"heaviness\" arises from the fact that these are heavy-fermion materials in which the inter-electron interactions increase the \"inertia\" of the quasiparticles. Other results suggest that the excitations in all three phases are described by spinons - spin-1/2 charge-neutral objects. These spinons are fractionalised excitations (to see why, recall that flipping a spin from -1/2 to 1/2 creates a spin-1 excitation). At the heart of these exotic phenomenon in this material is the underlying triangular lattice that leads to geometric frustration (it is not simple to obtain an energy-minimising configuration of spins on this lattice) and the emergence of novel elementary excitations (the spinons). Such a material provides a wonderful platform to realise and study these highly-correlated phases of matter."
